# Instructions:

1. Open the `setup.sh` file, and click the button to view the **Raw** file.
2. Copy the link to that file - or just copy this one; it should be the same:

        `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/el-ethan/fresh/master/setup.sh

3. Open a terminal window on the computer you want to provision, and navigate to your home directory (`cd ~` or just `cd`).
4. In the terminal run the `wget` command followed by the path from step 2:

    `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/el-ethan/fresh/master/setup.sh`

5. Make the newly downloaded script executable:

    `chmod +x setup.sh`

6. Run the script:

    `./setup.sh`

7. Sit back and watch your computer get provisioned, but don't go to far; one or two steps might require your input.
